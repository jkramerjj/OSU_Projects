    <h2 class="back_up">Purpose for the guide</h2>
    <p>The tutorial is dedicated to helping the novice user learn Node.js. First we focus on how to install correctly and then we work on the basics, leading up to coding asynchronously.  The tutorial will take place in the LINUX/UNIX command line environment. This guide 
      is designed to start with the very basics and to make "you" the reader feel comfortable navigating the complex and rewarding world of node.js. Are 
      you worried that you might not understand node.js? Even after researching it? Well don't, because if you've ever worked with JavaScript you've basically
      worked with node.js.  Here are a few reasons why learning node.js is a great idea! </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It's very fast, because it uses the V8 engine developed by Google
        <ul>
          <li>Meaning all your script is compiled into machine code. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Use the same programming language between the server and the database and back to the user.
        <ul>
          <li>There is no need for translating between client data and server data. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Websockets run over TCP
        <ul>
          <li>This means less overhead as compared to using HTTP</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Giant community
        <ul>
          <li>This is an active community with meet-ups, to open source, to dedicated IRC channels</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It's written in the most popular web development language in the world. </li>
      <li>JavaScript </li>
      <li> </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
    <p>Essentially it is an application written in Javascript that can be ran on systems from Windows, to OS X, to Linux, and more. 
      It is an open source cross-platform runtime environment for networking and server applications. If anything just think of it as a        
      &quot;server-side interpreter&quot; for JavaScript.</p>
    <h2>But what is one major benefit why I should consider Node.js?</h2>
    <p> Simplification.  Instead of using PHP, you can now use Node.js to communicate with the database.</p>
    <h2>How to Install</h2>
